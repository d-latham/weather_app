Weather Application

Weather plays an important role in our day to day activities. Based on the weather conditions we opt for different styles of clothing, plan our day based on road conditions as we commute home or to work, or adjust travel plans.  The end users of our web based weather application will be able to view the live weather data, hourly forecast, and daily forecast from 1 to 3 days. The app will also include astronomy data such as sunset, sunrise, moonset and moonrise time, as well as current moon phase. 

The users of the application will be presented with three menu options: Home Page, Hourly Forecast and Daily Astronomy. Each page is presented with a text box where users can enter their USA Zip Code or city to get the weather details. In addition to that, in the Hourly Forecast and Daily Astronomy pages the user is provided with a textbox to enter the number for days to view the forecast and the date of the day for which the user wants to know the astronomy of the sunrise, sunset, moonrise and moonset.

All of the data will be gathered using weatherapi.com. This api requires a key for which we have already created an account and received. Bootstrap will be used when creating the web application. There also may be additional information that would be available for “premium” users. To accomplish this we would use the authorization techniques we learned this semester. 

With the weather information available in an easily accessible web page, users will be able to plan their day or week by quickly glancing over the pages available on the web app. This will allow the end user to make the appropriate adjustments to their plans and travel arrangements.
